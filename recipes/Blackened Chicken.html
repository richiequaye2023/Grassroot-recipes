<h2><i>Blackened Chicken</i></h2>
<p>Blackened chicken is great on a summer's day with fresh corn and mashed potatoes.
    Food that is blackened isn't burnt; it's simply coated in a special spice blend that takes on a very dark brown, 
    almost black color when cooked in a skillet, on a grill or in an oven.
    Blackened food almost always means blackened meat, chicken or seafood, including fish and shellfish like shrimp. 
    Blackening spices are a blend that uses traditional herbs and spices from both Cajun and Creole cooking.</p>
